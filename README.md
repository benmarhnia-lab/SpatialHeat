# SpatialHeat
Project code from the within community matched design and BHM analysis of hospitalizations during heat waves in California


If you would like to Run the Shiny app you can open R and then run the following:

runGitHub( "benmarhnia-lab/SpatialHeat", "KristenHansen")

If you have any issues feel free to email me at k1hansen@ucsd.edu but if you are having trouble you can download this entire repository and run the app in RStudio by opening the app.R file changing rows 3 and 69 to match with your personal working directories and files (downloaded here). Then click Run.

Both of these methods should work the exact same way.
